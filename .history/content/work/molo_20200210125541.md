Molo is children’s fashion that’s heavy on the charm.

Their style is urban with funky, colourful designs that often have a humorous twist or are just quirky enough to get noticed - but never at the price of function and quality.

The design is a mix of fun, witty details and a cleaner, “raw” Scandinavian look.

BUSY has been working on expanding features for their webshop Molo.com.

BUSY has also helped in the devlopment for new features and performance optimisations in their internal apps which acts as vital tools for warehouse employees, store owners as well as sales staff.

A lot of their apps are custom build on an Angular frontend.
