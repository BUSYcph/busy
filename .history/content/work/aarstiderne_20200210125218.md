Aarstiderne's idea is simple

They grow organic vegetables in their garden and pack the season's best organic produce in a box, add recipes written for tasty everyday meals and deliver the box to customer’s front doors. They deliver vegetable and fruit boxes with fish and meal boxes, containing all the ingredients as well as recipes for 2 or 3 meals.

They deliver to around 45,000+ households in Denmark and 10,000 in Sweden. It's all about the joy of organic vegetables and tasty meals and Aarstiderne grows, like the seasons, year on year.

BUSY created a new front page for their site targeted at new visitors and with a purpose to tell Aarstidernes brand story which enables them differentiate themselves from their competitors.

It was an app-like experience rich on animation and modern navigation patterns.
