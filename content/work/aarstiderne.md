Aarstiderne's idea is simple

They grow organic vegetables in their garden and pack the season's best organic produce in a box, add recipes written for tasty everyday meals and deliver the box to customerâ€™s front doors. They deliver vegetable and fruit boxes with fish and meal boxes, containing all the ingredients as well as recipes for 2 or 3 meals.

They deliver to around 45,000+ households in Denmark and 10,000 in Sweden. It's all about the joy of organic vegetables and tasty meals and Aarstiderne grows, like the seasons, year on year.
