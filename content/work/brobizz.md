BroBizz is a Danish system for electronic toll collection, established in 2008. BroBizz A/S, a company wholly owned by Sund & BÃ¦lt Holding A/S, develops and manages the concept.

The project encompasses private and business areas, distributed across four country sites, each available in two languages. It is built on the CMS system Umbraco.

BUSY was responsible for developing the entire frontend layer for the assignment. They created a design system-driven component library that ensures high brand consistency throughout the application, thanks to its robust and reusable nature.

The server-side rendered React application is used both on the public-facing site and within the CMS system's preview function. This clever approach ensures that editors always see the same view when editing content as the final result displayed to page visitors.

BUSY completed the assignment as a subcontractor for the digital agency, <a href="https://apply.agency" target="_blank">Apply</a>, and delivered the project in just 6 weeks.
