DR (officially the Danish Broadcasting Corporation, a Danish public-service radio and television broadcasting company) needed a Touch Screen Application for their live television broadcast of the US elections. With a tight deadline of under a month, BUSY was tasked with not only developing the application but also conceptualizing the user interface and bringing their extensive consultancy expertise to the project.

The screen's objective was to act as a visual aid for the TV host, conveying election projections and results during the live TV coverage of the 2020 US election. The UI displayed a US-map view overlaying the live results of the various American states, as well as an interactive mandate calculator which enabled the host to drag and drop parts of the UI to set up possible election outcomes in an illustrative form.

The application was built for live television studio on-screen appearance, and BUSY was present during the entire election night, interacting with Project Managers, TV Producers, and providing on-going instructions to the host on the use of the touch screen. The quality of the application had to meet the high standards required for national television live broadcasting during the election night.

The technical details of its inner workings included React (written in TypeScript) on top of a Firebase Realtime Database with a direct mirroring of election results from Associated Press. The map was drawn dynamically from GeoJSON, and the drag-and-drop mandate calculator was designed with touch performance in mind. The project's successful completion within the tight deadline showcased BUSY's ability to deliver high-quality solutions under pressure and adapt to the client's evolving needs.
