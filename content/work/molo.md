Molo is children’s fashion that’s heavy on the charm.

Their style is urban with funky, colourful designs that often have a humorous twist or are just quirky enough to get noticed - but never at the price of function and quality.

The design is a mix of fun, witty details and a cleaner, “raw” Scandinavian look.
