Molo is a captivating children's fashion brand that effortlessly combines charm and style.

Their designs are urban, featuring funky and colorful patterns that often incorporate a humorous twist or just the right amount of quirkiness to stand out – all without compromising on function and quality. Molo's aesthetic combines playful, witty details with a clean, "raw" Scandinavian look that truly sets it apart.

BUSY has played an integral role in enhancing the online presence of Molo, working to expand features for their webshop at Molo.com. Additionally, BUSY has contributed to the development of new features and performance optimizations for Molo's suite of internal apps, which serve as essential tools for warehouse employees, store owners, and sales staff.

Many of these apps are custom-built with an Angular frontend, showcasing the adaptability and technical expertise that BUSY brings to the table for its clients.
