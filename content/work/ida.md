Ingeniørforeningen IDA wanted to gather its three existing websites under one single portal on top of a rebranded and unifying UI to increase coeherence between their offers and products, as well as to increase overall brand awareness among members.

In an aim to increase the overall User Experience and a more professional UI expression, the structure, design and information architecture for the website were rethought through Design Sprints, User and Business Involvement and User Tests.

&middot;

BUSY has for more than two years participated in the work on the project through various phases.

Work has been done on advisory in the Design Phase, bridging communication between Graphic Designers and Technical Developers, and also with the hands on development of a centrally located modern design system and UI kit built with React on top of TypeScript, which ensures a brand consistent presentation of the user interface on IDA's web applications, as well as a top of the line developer experience when IDAs own developers is interacting with the product.
