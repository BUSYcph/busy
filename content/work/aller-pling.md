Pling offers customers access to all their favorite magazines in one convenient app, ensuring the latest issues are always at their fingertips, whether they're reading at home, on the train, or on vacation.

The app features a wide selection of both Danish and international titles, providing exciting reading material for the whole family – from the latest gossip to sports, gadgets, beauty, home, health, and lifestyle content.

As a subcontractor to the Danish consultancy agency Immeo, BUSY was responsible for translating the design composition created in Sketch into a plug-and-play UI component library. This library forms the foundation of the entire user interface on the onboarding site, pling.dk. Throughout the project, BUSY maintained close communication with both Immeo and the client to ensure high-quality results.
